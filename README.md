Data Science Final Project

This project applies clustering techniques to analyze a dataset containing salary, demographic, and educational background information. The primary goal is to identify meaningful patterns and groupings based on various factors such as salary, gender, years of experience, and educational qualifications.


Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles and prepares the dataset for analysis by cleaning and structuring data appropriately.
Clustering Analysis: Implements clustering techniques to group individuals based on shared characteristics.
Cluster Summary: Generates summary statistics for each cluster, offering insights into average salary, years of experience, education level, and demographics.
Visualization: Includes visualizations to help interpret the clustering results and understand trends in the data.


Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
Ensure that all dependencies are installed before running the notebook.


Usage
Load the Dataset: The dataset should be loaded into the notebook. Make sure the file path is correct and matches your directory structure.
Preprocessing: Execute the data cleaning and preprocessing steps to handle missing values and prepare the data for clustering.
Clustering: Run the clustering algorithms to create groups based on the selected features.
Analysis: Review the generated cluster summaries to interpret the results.
Visualization: Explore the data through visualizations such as scatter plots and histograms.


Results
The clustering analysis groups individuals into categories based on shared attributes, enabling insights into trends such as:

How educational background correlates with salary.
The demographic distribution within each cluster.
The effect of years of experience on salary levels.


Summary Statistics
The project includes a table summarizing the average values of key variables for each cluster, such as:

Base Salary
Years of Experience
Educational Background
Demographic Information


Getting Started
To run this project:

Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Install the required dependencies if necessary.
Execute the cells in sequence to see the results.
Acknowledgments
This project was developed as part of a Data Science course final assessment. The dataset used for this analysis includes anonymized salary and demographic data.
